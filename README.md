# Maritime-GrayZone-Attribution
A computational framework for minimizing attribution delay in maritime gray-zone incidents via AIS-SAR data fusion (Case Study: High North/Arctic)

# Maritime Gray-Zone Attribution Framework

## 🎯 Research Objective
To minimize **Attribution Delay** in maritime gray-zone warfare by fusing **AIS (Signal)** and **SAR (Index)** data. This project focuses on the **High North (Arctic/North Atlantic)**, aligning with the **NSS 2025** priorities for undersea infrastructure resilience.

## 🔬 Core Hypothesis (H1)
Automated detection of **Functional Indices** (e.g., Velocity Deviation $V_{dev}$ and Displacement-Draft Paradox) can identify subsea sabotage in real-time, bypassing political deniability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (GeoPandas, Shapely)
- **Data:** Global Fishing Watch (AIS), Copernicus Sentinel-1 (SAR)
- **Frameworks:** Jervis (1970) Signaling Theory, Gartzke & Lindsay (2015) Attribution Logic.
